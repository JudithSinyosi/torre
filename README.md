## Customization Guide

The various sections in the HTML and CSS are well commented, so feel free to change whatever doesn't suit you need.

The JavaScript functions are commented too, so you will know what the functions and selections do.

I used Ion Icons and Icons8 for the icons, but feel free to use fontawesome or any other icon library you want.
